## Known gaps

- emulate.dev Stripe has no subscription objects/events (only `checkout.session.completed|expired`); subscription webhook flow needs opt-in Stripe CLI or staging.
- TypeScript 7 has no programmatic API; tools importing `typescript` alias to `@typescript/typescript6`.
- oxfmt is 0.x (beta); Prettier-conformant for JS/TS.

## Drift during implementation (2026-09-02)

Deviations from the plan above, discovered while building — these are the current truth:

- **Prisma 7.10, not 8**: npm `latest` was 8.0.0-rc; RC skipped deliberately. Datasource URL lives in `prisma.config.ts` (Prisma 7 moved it out of the schema); runtime adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) is constructed in `createDb`.
- **evlog on web uses `evlog/workers`**, not a `tanstack-start` adapter (doesn't exist in evlog 2.28); the custom `src/server.ts` Worker entry wraps the Start handler with paraglide + evlog. Axiom drain export is `createAxiomDrain`.
- **React Compiler via `@vitejs/plugin-react` v6 `compiler: true`** (oxc-transform-react) — v6 removed the `babel` option, so no babel preset.
- **`/dashboard` is `ssr: false`**: the session cookie belongs to the api origin and isn't forwarded during SSR; an SSR auth check bounced logged-in users (found by e2e).
- **CORS is load-bearing**: web and api are always cross-origin (ports locally, subdomains in prod). `@fastify/cors` with `credentials: true`, origin from `WEB_URL`. Removing it hangs every browser auth call (found by e2e).
- **Pre-hydration guard**: root sets `data-hydrated` on `<html>`; e2e waits for it. Submitting a form before hydration triggers a native GET submit (credentials in URL).
- **Compose Postgres on host port 5433** (5432 commonly occupied); container-internal stays 5432.
- **skills-npm dropped**: no installed dep ships `skills/` in its npm tarball today; `skills` CLI lock + `skills.versions.json` drift check cover maintenance.
- **Better Auth CLI is stale** (1.4.x vs better-auth 1.7): auth schema was written against 1.7's canonical tables by hand; don't rerun `@better-auth/cli generate` blindly.
- **Stripe event idempotency guards only custom `onEvent` logic**: the plugin has no pre-hook; its built-in handlers are upsert-idempotent.
