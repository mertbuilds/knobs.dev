# knobs

The marketing site for the `devknobs` npm package. <https://knobs.dev>

A copy of [mertbuilds/web-starter](https://github.com/mertbuilds/web-starter) with everything a
landing page does not need taken out: no api, no database, no auth, no billing, no e2e. What is
left is a TanStack Start app on Cloudflare Workers, the StyleX component package behind it, and
the tooling that keeps both honest. The founding stack decisions are in
[docs/adr/0001-stack.md](docs/adr/0001-stack.md) — that record covers the whole boilerplate, and
this repo keeps only the web half. Agent rules and workflow live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Stack

| Layer       | Choice                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Monorepo    | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo, Node 24, TypeScript 7                       |
| Web         | TanStack Start (React 19 + Compiler) → Cloudflare Workers                |
| Styling     | StyleX tokens (black/white, 4px radius) + Base UI components + Storybook |
| i18n        | Paraglide v2 (en only)                                                   |
| Analytics   | Self-hosted OpenPanel, page views only, `/api/op` reverse proxy          |
| Logging     | evlog wide events to an Axiom drain                                      |
| Lint/format | oxlint (`@nkzw/oxlint-config`, type-aware) + oxfmt — no ESLint/Prettier  |
| Tests       | Vitest, Storybook stories as tests in real Chromium                      |

## Develop

Prereqs: Node 24 (`nvm use`), pnpm 11 (corepack).

```sh
pnpm install
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
sudo pnpm exec portless proxy start --https   # one-time: local HTTPS proxy on 443 + trusted CA
pnpm dev                                      # mprocs: web + storybook
```

Local URLs come from [portless](https://portless.sh) — stable named HTTPS domains instead of ports:

| Service   | URL                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| web       | https://knobs.localhost           |
| storybook | https://storybook.knobs.localhost |

`pnpm exec portless service install` starts the proxy on boot.

| Command             | What it does                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`          | Web + storybook, in mprocs panes                                   |
| `pnpm test`         | Storybook story tests in real Chromium                             |
| `pnpm lint`         | oxlint, type-aware                                                 |
| `pnpm format:check` | oxfmt, the CI check                                                |
| `pnpm typecheck`    | `tsc --noEmit` per package                                         |
| `pnpm build`        | turbo build (the Workers bundle for `apps/web`)                    |
| `pnpm storybook`    | Component workshop (standalone, :6006)                             |
| `pnpm fonts`        | Fetch Suisse Intl from private bucket (Inter fallback otherwise)   |
| `pnpm bad-day`      | Nuke node_modules + all caches, reinstall (`DRY_RUN=1` to preview) |
| `pnpm skills:check` | Warn when dep majors drift from verified agent skills              |

**Fonts.** Suisse Intl is licensed and not in the repo. Without
`packages/ui/fonts/*.woff2` the site falls back to Inter and everything else works.

**Env.** Every var is optional — the site runs with no `.env` at all, just without analytics.

**Deploy.** `pnpm --filter @knobs/web deploy` builds and ships to Cloudflare Workers; a push to
main does the same from CI.

## Going to production — accounts checklist

- [ ] **Cloudflare** — Workers; secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in GitHub
- [ ] **Custom domains** — `knobs.dev` and `www.knobs.dev` attached to the `knobs-web` Worker
- [ ] **OpenPanel** — repo variable `OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID` (public project id); without it production ships without analytics
- [ ] **Axiom** — dataset + token as Worker secrets (`AXIOM_TOKEN`, `AXIOM_DATASET`) for the evlog drain
- [ ] **Suisse Intl bucket** — `FONT_BUCKET_URL` secret (private R2); Inter ships as fallback
- [ ] **Branch protection** — PRs only, CI required on `main`
- [ ] **Turbo remote cache** (optional) — `TURBO_TOKEN` secret + `TURBO_TEAM` var
